## Audio Classification Model

### Overview
This project involves building an audio classification model using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to classify audio signals into predefined categories based on their features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled audio files. Each audio file is associated with a specific class label, representing the category it belongs to.

### Preprocessing
1. *Audio Loading*: Audio files are loaded and converted into a consistent format.
2. *Feature Extraction*: Key features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and spectral contrast are extracted from the audio signals.
3. *Normalization*: The extracted features are normalized to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

### Model Architecture
The model is built using a deep learning framework, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature learning and classification. The architecture includes:
- *Input Layer*: Accepts the preprocessed audio features.
- *Convolutional Layers*: Extracts spatial hierarchies of features.
- *Pooling Layers*: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- *Fully Connected Layers*: Performs the final classification based on the learned features.
- *Output Layer*: Produces the probability distribution over the classes.

### Training
The model is trained using a supervised learning approach. The dataset is split into training and validation sets. The training process involves:
- *Loss Function*: Categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function.
- *Optimizer*: Adam optimizer is employed to minimize the loss.
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying audio signals. Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrix are provided in the results section.

### Usage
To use the model for audio classification:
1. *Load the Model*: Load the pre-trained model from the provided file.
2. *Preprocess Audio*: Preprocess the input audio file to extract features.
3. *Predict*: Use the model to predict the class of the audio signal.

### Conclusion
This audio classification model provides a robust solution for categorizing audio signals. Future work includes exploring more advanced architectures and larger datasets to further improve performance.
